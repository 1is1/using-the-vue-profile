To get started with this profile, specify it when generating your app:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-app myApp --profile=vue
----

You can also generate your project using the http://start.grails.org[Application Forge], either from the web interface or using the following `curl` command:

[source,bash]
----
curl -O start.grails.org/myApp.zip -d version=3.3.2 -d profile=vue
----


Take a look at the directory structure - you will see a typical Gradle multi-project build, with separate client and server projects.

[source,groovy]

The `server` project is our Grails application. The profile will generate a Grails app using the `rest-api` profile, which provides support for creating domain classes as restful resources, CORS enabled by default, as well as JSON and Markup views.

`client` is our Vue app.

The `client` project structure (with the exception of `build.gradle`, which is specific to the profile) is all courtesy of Vue-CLI's `webpack` template, and includes an excellent README file. In short, the `src/` directory is where the Vue source code is kept, with subdirectories for `/components , `/assets`, and `config`.

The `static/` directory is for public resources that you wish to make available from your Vue app without being bundled by webpack. There is also a root `index.html` file which is used to generate the Vue appâ€™s home page. Again, see the http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/[Vue-CLI template documentation] for more details.

If you edit the file `config/dev.env.js`, you will see that the profile has added an additional configuration property to the template defaults:
[source, javascript]
----
'use strict'
const merge = require('webpack-merge')
const prodEnv = require('./prod.env')

module.exports = merge(prodEnv, {
  NODE_ENV: '"development"',
  SERVER_URL: '"http://localhost:8080"' //<1>
})

----
<1> `SERVER_URL` points to the default address of the `server` Grails application, and is used as the base URL for REST calls from the Vue app.

You can change the existing configuration properties or add new ones to this file; they will apply to the "development" environment (note that the `client` environments are based on the scripts in `client/package.json`, and are not related to Grails' environments).
